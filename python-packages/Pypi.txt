This file is meant as an intro into this package.

In the python-standard-lib we took a look at the different useful modules included in the python standard library.
Even though this library is very comprehensive, it doesn't have everything we need when building a real world application.

That's where Pypi will come in useful, you can see it as a package manager [just like npm for JS developers].
These packages are written by people like you and me.

Pretty much everything you can come up with or need, there will be a project on the site.

Beware: Not all packages are working or complete, google it or take some time to search for a better package on there.

We are going to learn how to install these packages.
